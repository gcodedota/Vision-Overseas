Specific Addapter Configuration
===============================

Gaufrette does not come with a lot detail about what exactly some adapters expect so here is a list to help you with that.

But you should not blindly copy and paste that code, get an understanding of the storage service you want to use before!

Keep in mind that the instructions here might be outdated as external APIs and SDKs can and probably will change at some time! If this happens please create an issue ticket on Github and include the way to configure the adapter.

Local Filesystem
----------------

By default the StorageManager already comes with a pre-configured adapter instance for the local file system adapter.

The first array element of the `adapterOptions` config key is `TMP` because the tmp folder and the logs folder should be the only writeable place in a *proper* configured application. The reason for that is simply to make it work out of the box without issues. **You definitely want to change that path for your application.**

```php
StorageManager::config('Local', [
	'adapterOptions' => [TMP, true],
	'adapterClass' => '\Gaufrette\Adapter\Local',
	'class' => '\Gaufrette\Filesystem'
]);
```

You should create another folder *outside* your `src` folder and [symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) it if you need it to be present somewhere in webroot. For example use this as the base path for your local files. The following code is an *example*:

```php
'adapterOptions' => [ROOT . DS . 'file_storage', true],
```

Symlink Linux Example:

```
 ln -s /home/myuser/projects/my-app/webroot/img/uploads /home/myuser/projects/my-app/file_storage
```

Symlink Windows Example:

```
mklink /D "C:\webstack\htdocs\my-app\webroot\img\uploads" "C:\webstack\htdocs\my-app\file_storage"
```

AmazonS3 - AwsS3 Adapter
------------------------

Get the SDK from here https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php or get it via composer ```aws/aws-sdk-php```. If you're not using composer you'll have to add it to your own autoloader or load it manually.

```php
use Aws\S3;

$S3Client = \Aws\S3\S3Client::factory(array(
	'key' => 'YOUR-KEY',
	'secret' => 'YOUR-SECRET'
));

StorageManager::config('S3Image', array(
	'adapterOptions' => array(
		$S3Client,
		'YOUR-BUCKET-HERE',
		array(),
		true
	),
	'adapterClass' => '\Gaufrette\Adapter\AwsS3',
	'class' => '\Gaufrette\Filesystem')
);
```

AmazonS3 - AmazonS3 Adapter (legacy)
------------------------------------

*This adapter is legacy code, you should use the AwsS3 adapter instead!*

Get the SDK from here http://github.com/amazonwebservices/aws-sdk-for-php and load the sdk.class.php file from where ever you cloned the SDK. Or get it via composer ```amazonwebservices/aws-sdk-for-php```.

```php
require_once(APP . 'Vendor' . DS . 'AwsSdk' . DS . 'sdk.class.php');

CFCredentials::set(array(
	'production' => array(
			'certificate_authority' => true,
			'key' => 'YOUR-KEY',
			'secret' => 'YOUR-SECRET'
		)
	)
);
$s3 = new AmazonS3();

StorageManager::config('S3', array(
	'adapterOptions' => array(
		$s3,
		'YOUR-BUCKET-HERE'
	),
	'adapterClass' => '\Gaufrette\Adapter\AmazonS3',
	'class' => '\Gaufrette\Filesystem')
);
```

OpenCloud (Rackspace)
---------------------

Get the SDK from here http://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud and add it to your class autoloader

```php
define('RAXSDK_SSL_VERIFYHOST', 0);
define('RAXSDK_SSL_VERIFYPEER', 0);

$connection = new \OpenCloud\Rackspace(
	'https://lon.identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/', // Rackspace Auth URL
	array(
		'username' => 'YOUR-USERNAME',
		'apiKey' => 'YOUR-API-KEY'
	)
);

// LON (London) or DFW (Dallas)
$objstore = $connection->ObjectStore('cloudFiles', 'LON');

StorageManager::config('OpenCloudTest', array(
	'adapterOptions' => array(
		$objstore,
		'test1',
	),
	'adapterClass' => '\Gaufrette\Adapter\OpenCloud',
	'class' => '\Gaufrette\Filesystem')
);
```

Azure
-----

Attention: This adapter config was provided by a third party. If you encounter any trouble with it please report it and the best submit a working example.

```php
$connectionString = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=;AccountKey=";
$blobRestProxy = new Gaufrette\Adapter\AzureBlobStorage\BlobProxyFactory($connectionString);
$blobRestProxy->create();

StorageManager::config('AzureBlobStorage', [
    'adapterOptions' => [
        $blobRestProxy,
        'gatewayfiles'
    ],
    'adapterClass' => '\Gaufrette\Adapter\AzureBlobStorage',
    'class' => '\Gaufrette\Filesystem'
]);
```
