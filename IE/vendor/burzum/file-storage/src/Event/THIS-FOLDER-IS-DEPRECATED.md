The event listeners have been *completly* overhauled and rewritten.

The content of this folder is deprecatd and is going to be removed within the new few month with the release of the 2.0 version of the plugin.

While the new listeners will feature a backward compatible listener it is strongly recommended to already switch and use the new listeners.
